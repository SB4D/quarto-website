I'm a mathematician with roughly a decade of university level research and teaching under my belt. 
I also like computers and I've decided that this is what I want to do now. 

### Math
My research area is the topology of [4-dimensional manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-manifold) within the broader field of geometry and topology. 
If you're also interested in these things, you may have seen [my name on the cover of a book](https://academic.oup.com/book/43693). 
You can find more about my research in the [math section](math.qmd).

### Computers
Since I've left academia, I've been on a deep dive into [data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science), [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), and related areas of software development. I've been working on a few projects that I'll describe in more detail in the [projects section](projects.qmd).

### Music
Music has always been my hobby but lately it has also served as an inspiration for coding projects. 
<!-- The computer aided analysis of music and audio signals is a reliable source of problems. -->
I'm currently exploring various concepts of deep learning in the context of computer aided analysis of music and audio signals.
I've also been getting more into [digital signal processing (DSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing) and [music information retrieval (MIR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_information_retrieval) and this will be reflected in various posts in the [my blog](blog.qmd).
