    "**Libraries:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* As most people, I use [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) for low-level processing and analysis.\n",
    "* I like to use [librosa](https://librosa.org/) for reading audio and high-level analysis. \n",
    "* I've been using [`sounddevice`](https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/) for playback.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Conventions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mono** audio is modeled by 1d NumPy Arrays.\n",
    "* **Stereo** (or multi-channel) audio is modeled by 2d NumPy arrays of shape `(num_channels, num_samples)`.\n",
    "* In both cases, the sample values are **32-bit floating point** numbers **between -1 and 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've adopted these conventions from librosa.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Caution:** Other audio library might deviates from these conventions. For example, `sounddevice` requires the multi-channel arrays to have shape `(num_samples, num_channels)`. This necessitates an occasional transposition.*"

    "## The Math of Panning and Stereo Width\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going into code, I like to be clear about the math that runs the show. Let's start with a sampled audio signal in mono. There are at least three common ways to model this mathematically:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A finite sequence of real numbers $x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{N-1}\\in\\R$ of length $N\\ge0$.\n",
    "* A vector $x = (x_0,x_1,\\dots,x_{N-1})\\in\\R^N$ \n",
    "* A function $x\\colon \\Z\\to\\R$ with values $x[n] = x_n$ for $0\\le n <N$ and $x[n]=0$ otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "I prefer the last option, because in my mind a signal is a function of time - in this case modeled by the integers $\\Z$ - and the notation $x[n]$ for the sample values is the same in Python code. This also frees up the subscript notation and allows me to write stereo signals as tuples $x = (x_L, x_R)$ of functions $x_L, x_R\\colon \\Z\\to\\R$, each of which can be viewed as a mono signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my mathematically wired brain, I also like to think of operations that transform a given signal into another one (e.g. filtering, panning, etc.) as a map between sets of signals. \n",
    "I'll use the notation $\\mathcal S_1$ and $\\mathcal S_2$ for the sets of mono and stereo signals, respectively. Here's a formal definition:\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\mathcal{S}_1 &= \\{x\\colon \\Z\\to\\R \\mid \\text{$x[n] = 0$ for $n<0$ and $n\\gg 0$} \\} \\\\\n",
    "\\mathcal{S}_2 &= \\{x = (x_L,x_R) \\mid x_L, x_R\\in\\mathcal{S_1} \\}.\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "Just to give an example of an operation, the process of extracting only the left channel from a stereo signal is formally given by the map\n",
    "$$ T\\colon \\mathcal S_2 \\to \\mathcal S_1,\\quad x = (x_L, x_R) \\mapsto x_L = T(x). $$\n"

    "### Equal Power Panning of Mono Signals\n",
    "\n",
    "Say I have a mono signal $x_0$ and I want to play it back on my stereo system. How can I do that? There are at three obvious ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hard Left Panning:** I could only use the left speaker and play back the stereo signal (x_0, 0)$.\n",
    "* **Hard Right Panning:** I could only use the right speaker and play back the stereo signal $(0, x_0)$.\n",
    "* **Naive Center Panning:** I could use both speaker to play back the stereo signal $(x_0, x_0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, neither of them is perfect. Obviously, the stereo system is designed to have equal amounts of sound coming out of both speaker, which is just not happening for the hard panned signals. On the plus side, the hard panned signals have the advantage that they are guaranteed to be played back at the correct loudness, as they are equivalent to playing back the mono signal $x_0$ on a mono system. In contrast, the naive center panning turns out to be a little too loud.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is actually a somewhat subtle point, since the **perceived loudness** depends on many unknown factors (e.g. speaker placement, room acoustics, listener position, etc) and the dependence is a lot more complicated for stereo systems due to interferences between the left and right speakers. As it turns out, the perceived loudness of a signal is proportional to the signal's power, which is, in turn, **proportional to the point-wise square norm of the signal**. This goes for mono *and* stereo signals under a **diffuse sound field** assumption which is reasonably well justified for realistic stereo playback scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming back to the three obvious panning options for the mono signal $x_0$, we find that the signal power is proportional to\n",
    "$$ \\|(x_0, 0)\\|^2 = \\|(0, x_0)\\|^2 = x_0^2 \\quad\\text{while}\\quad \\|(x_0, x_0)\\|^2 = x_0^2+x_0^2 = 2 x_0^2. $$\n",
    "On the one hand, this quantifies how much too loud the naive center panning is.\n",
    "On the other hand, it suggests a way out of this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **(equal power) center panning** of a mono signal $x_0$ is the stereo signal $(x_0/\\sqrt2, x_0/\\sqrt2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a side note, multiplication with $1/\\sqrt2 = 0.707\\dots$ corresponds to a decrease in level by roughly 3 dB, and the equal power condition is sometimes also called the [3 dB panning law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panning_law). Another fun fact is the observation that $1/\\sqrt2 = \\cos(\\pi/4) = \\sin(\\pi/4)$, which can be seen geometrically by viewing the line from the origin in $\\R^2$ to the unit circle at a 45Â° angle as the diagonal in a square whose side length are given by the sine and cosine values at $\\pi/4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometry also helps to find more ways to distribute the mono signal $x_0$ between the left and right channels of a stereo system:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An **equal power panning** of a mono signal $x_0$ has the form $(\\lambda x_0, \\rho x_0)$ with $\\lambda,\\rho\\ge0$ satisfying $\\lambda^2 + \\rho^2 = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrically, the pairs $(\\lambda, \\rho)$ above are precisely the points on the unit circle in the first quadrant of $\\R^2$. Hence, for each such pair $(\\lambda, \\rho)$ there is exactly one angle $\\alpha\\in [0,\\pi/2]$ such that\n",
    "$$ \\lambda = \\cos(\\alpha) \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\rho = \\sin(\\alpha). $$\n",
    "For $\\alpha = 0 $ and $\\alpha = \\pi/2$ this gives back the hard left and right pannings, and the above detour about $1/\\sqrt2$ shows that the center panning arises for $\\alpha = \\pi/4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equal power pannings can be parameterized by an interval and continuously interpolate between the hard left and right pannings. In practice, it is more convenient to re-parameterize the interval $[0,\\pi/2]$ to the unit interval $[-1,1]$ using the affine rescaling function\n",
    "$$ [-1,1] \\to [0,\\pi/2],\\quad p \\mapsto \\frac\\pi4 (p + 1) =: \\alpha_p. $$\n",
    "In terms of the **position parameter** $p$, the hard left, center, and hard right pannings correspond to $p=-1$, $p=0$, and $p=1$, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the the family of equal power pannings of $x_0$ can be written as follows:\n",
    "$$ P_p\\colon \\mathcal S_1 \\to\\mathcal S_2, \\quad \n",
    "P_p(x_0) = x_0\\cdot \\big( \\cos(\\alpha_p), \\sin(\\alpha_p) \\big),\n",
    "\\quad p \\in[-1,1]. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Lastly, there is yet another way to look at this. For $p\\in[-1,1]$ consider the matrix\n",
    "$$ R_p = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(p\\pi/4) & -\\sin(p\\pi/4) \\\\ \\sin(p\\pi/4) & \\cos(p\\pi/4) \\end{pmatrix}. $$\n",
    "Multiplication by $R_p$ represents a counterclockwise rotation in $\\R^2$ by the angel $p\\pi/4$. Writing $x_{cen} = (x_0/\\sqrt2, x_0/\\sqrt2)$ for the center panning, all other equal power pannings are obtained by $R_px_{cen}$. -->\n"

    "### Adjusting Stereo Width\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let $x=(x_L,x_R)$ be a stereo signal. Mathematically, the mono signals $x_L$ and $x_R$ in the left and right channels are the point-wise coordinates with respect to the canonical basis of $\\R^2$ given by $e_L=(1,0)$ and $e_R=(0,1)$. This happens to be an orthonormal basis. \n",
    "Another orthonormal basis is given by $e_M=\\frac1{\\sqrt2}(1, 1)$ and $e_S=\\frac1{\\sqrt2}(-1, 1)$, and the corresponding coordinates of $x$ are the **mid channel** $x_M$ and the **side channels** $x_S$ given by\n",
    "$$x_M = \\frac{x_L + x_R}{\\sqrt 2} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad x_S = \\frac{x_L - x_R}{\\sqrt 2}.$$\n",
    "Formally, we can write the entire stereo signal as\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "x %&= x_L\\cdot e_L + x_R\\cdot e_R = (x_L, 0) + (0, x_R) \\\\\n",
    "&= x_M\\cdot e_M + x_S\\cdot e_S = \\underbrace{\\tfrac12(x_L+x_R,x_L+x_R)}_{\\text{mid signal}} + \\underbrace{\\tfrac12(x_L-x_R,x_R-x_L)}_{\\text{side signal}}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "The **mid signal** is nothing but the center panning of the mid channel $x_M$, which is also called the **mixdown** of the stereo signal. The **side signal** is the part that make the signal truly stereo. \n",
    "\n",
    "As far as I can tell, the concept of \"stereo width\" used in most digital audio workstatsions (DAWs) is largely based on the level of the side signal. More precisely, the stereo width adjustment appears to be modeled by introducing **width parameter** $w\\in[0,1]$ used to linearly scale the side signal:\n",
    "$$ W_w(x) = x_M\\cdot e_M + w\\cdot (x_S\\cdot e_S),\\quad w\\in[0,1]. $$\n",
    "For $w=1$ this recovers the original signal, while for $w=0$ only the mid signal is returned:\n",
    "$$ W_1(x) = x_M\\cdot e_M + x_S\\cdot e_S = x,\\quad \n",
    " W_0(x) = x_M\\cdot e_M. $$\n",
    "As the width parameter decreases from 1 to 0, the signal sounds narrower and narrower until it becomes a center panned mono signal.\n",
    "Typically, the perceived loudness decreases along with the width.\n",
    "Indeed, the power decreases:\n",
    "$$ \\|W_w(x)\\|^2 = x_M^2 + w^2x_S^2 \\le x_M^2 + x_S^2 = \\|x\\|^2 $$\n",
    "Equality holds if and only $x_S=0$, meaning that $x$ was a center panned mono signal.."
